This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged Net::Telnet.  This package was
put together by Michael Alan Dorman <mdorman@debian.org>.  The
original sources should always be available from the Comprehensive
Perl Archive Network (CPAN). Visit <URL:http://www.perl.com/CPAN/> to
find a CPAN site near you.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files.
